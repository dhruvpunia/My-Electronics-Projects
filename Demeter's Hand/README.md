                             Project Synopsis
           Topic-Agriculture & Organic Farming

Project Name:  Demeter(the Greek Goddess of Agriculture)

Introduction : Food is  very important because it is our main source of  food supply .The agriculture industry is a key one in the development  of any nation ,it is the central industry of every developing nation. If agriculture is not safe, healthy and sustainable , it is essential to have healthy crops ; they play a great role in producing sufficient quantities of healthy food and contribute to the quality of life.

Problem:  About 30-35% of the annual crop yield in India gets wasted because of pests , diseases and weeds .Vast fields and low efficiency in crop monitoring together create farming’s largest obstacle. Monitoring challenges are exacerbated by increasingly unpredictable weather conditions ,which drive risk and field maintenance costs

Theory : A normal healthy plant  will absorb blue and red light  and reflect green light ,which is why they appear green to our eyes. With the green visible light ,plants also reflect Near-Infrared (NIR)light .This type of light which is invisible to human eye , also isn’t actively used for photosynthesis process , and the healthier the plant ,the more NIR light will be reflected ,When a plant becomes dehydrated or stressed ,the spongy layer of the leaves collapses and it’s leaves reflect less NIR light , yet they still reflect same amount of light in visible range. This is called NDVI .
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),simply put, is a calculation for vegetation or crop health. Mathematically comparing red and NIR light signals can help differentiate plan from non-plant and healthy plant from sick plant
NDVI enables agronomists and farmers to see stressed crops in a field up to two weeks before the human eye would  be able to detect. Crops stress sooner in NRI than they do in visible spectrum ,so growers can identify diseases ,pests ,fungus ,or arid conditions sooner , and then respond and make quicker decisions before  the issues become even a bigger problem .

Solution :We have come up with a device called Demeter.This device is divided into three parts - DemeterHand,DemeterDrone and DemeterRover ,for different farm sizes and uses.But all of them use the NDVI system explained above. By scanning a crop using both visible and near-infrared light ,the drone and rover carried DemeterHand can identify which plants reflect different amount of green light  and NIR light. This information can produce  multispectral image images  that track changes  in plants and indicate their health .A speedy response  can save an entire orchard .In addition , as soon as a sickness is discovered, farmers can apply and monitor remedies more precisely .These two possibilities increase a plant’s  ability to overcome diseases .And in the case of crop failure  the farmer will be able to document losses more efficiently for insurance claim.      
DemeterHand :The handheld DemeterHand device is smartphone size device consisting of an                   onboard credit card size computer  completed with a IR camera that can observe IR radiation.The handheld Device can be used to scan singular plant images in small fields or can be used by Orchards owner for checking their trees health.The NDIV color map will be shown right on the lcd screen attached to the  device .It is the cheaper alternative for those farmers who cannot afford to buy the DemeterDrone or DemeterRover.This handheld device would cost about Rs. 3000. 
DemeterDrone: Drone technology  will give the agriculture industry a high-technology makeover,with planning and strategy based on real-time NDVI data gathering and processing.With large farms including hundreds of acres require aerial view of the field for data gathering .The fully autonomous drone  would require zero user interaction performing all activities without any commands .The drone can virtualize the entire field into a color map .This technology is suitable for very large farms .This device is collaboration of the DemeterHand and Drone .Thus the DemeterHand can be used separately by plugging it out of the system. This device would cost approx.  Rs. 5500 but the price is nothing compared to the functionality.
DemeterRover: DemeterRover is a fully autonomous bot with integrated DemeterHand NDVI technology .This rover works with the help of global positioning system and requires the user to only define the waypoints through which scanning has to be done .This device is favourable for Potato ,Carrot or turnip Plantation because the plants are small and there are enough spaces between the plant strips through which the rover can easily navigate. The cost of this system is approx. Rs 4000 .

Advantages: The Demeter system has various advantages which can greatly hep the farmers –
1.	Versatility: The Demeter devices are very  versatile and can be used with many types of farms and conditions 
2.	Cost Factor: Cost is a very important aspect in deciding the future of a agritech technology as it has to be cheap so that all types of farmers ranging from poor to rich can afford them
3.	One time investment: There is only the initial cost of buying the product as all the products run on electricity which can be taken from the solar energy
4.	Economic Growth: With the new data inputs from the farm ,the farmers can manage their farms in a better and efficient way
